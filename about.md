title: About
---

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong interest in ethical hacking, penetration testing, vulnerability analysis and network security. Since September 2020 I have been studing a BSc (Hons) degree in Ethical Hacking at Abertay University. I am part of various communities where i try to involve myself as much as possible and learn from those who are willing to teach me a thing or two. If you have helped me in the past to get me where i am today, then you have my undying gratitude.

I find myself regularly completing CTF challenges and partaking in TryHackMe learning rooms. This space acts as a repository for anything i find interesting and wish to post for public viewing such as uni work, proffesional projects, CTF writeups etc. If you find an error in my work, please reach out as i am always looking to improve myself.

Let me know if you wish to use my work for something else!
