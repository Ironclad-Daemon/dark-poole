I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong interest in ethical hacking, penetration testing, vulnerability analysis and network security. Since September 2020 I have been studing a BSc (Hons) degree in Ethical Hacking at Abertay University. I find myself regularly completing CTF challenges and partaking in TryHackMe learning rooms. 

This space acts as a repository for anything i find interesting and wish to post for public viewing such as uni work, proffesional projects, CTF writeups etc. If you find an error in my work, please reach out as i am always looking to improve myself!
