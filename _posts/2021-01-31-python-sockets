## Introduction

I took a look into python sockets and created a UDP calculator, and a TCP document statistic reporting tool. Collated below are my breif notes.

## UDP Calculator

When we run the UDP Server the socket is started on port 8888 of our localhost, and it just waits for a client to send data. 
-	The client will send the first integer followed by the operator, followed by the second integer.
-	The server receives and reads those messages, calculates the sum based off the operator and will then send the answer back to the client. 
-	The client decodes and outputs the sum to the terminal. 
The working scenario can be seen in the screenshot below. (The top left is the client and bottom right is the server)
