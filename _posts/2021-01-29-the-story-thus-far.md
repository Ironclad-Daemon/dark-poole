## Introuduction

In this post I briefly cover how I got to where I am today. In future years i wish to look back on this post and reflect on my decision making.

## The story thus far

I started out working as a Network Engineer, I thoroughly enjoyed the role and got involved with a lot of wireless network installations, server migrations, and just overall keeping the business up and running. Then I started to get into the security side of the job, working on firewall configurations and endpoint lockdowns. Although this was deemed basic in retrospect its what kick-started my interest in cyber security.

I started researching cyber roles and careers, I joined numerous infosec communities where I conversed with many professionals about their roles and came to the conclusion that I wanted to work on the red team potentially as a penetration tester. I started studying for entry-level certifications such as CompTIA Network+, which I achieved last year, then went on to study for the Security+. Simultaneously whilst working 40+hr weeks and studying, I was active on TryHackMe, a free resource that I have gained a tremendous amount of knowledge from.

After a lot of job market research, I found that most high-end red team cybersecurity jobs wanted degrees, and after doing what I was doing for a while I soon realised I would regret not going to university whilst I was still young. To my friends and family, it was a pretty spontaneous decision to drop what I had, almost overnight, and move to Scotland to study at Abertay University. 

Now im 400* miles from home starting a career in cybersecurity based on a whim!
